## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, an image classifier built with TensorFlow was developed.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project was developed using the following libraries:

tensorflow version: 2.4.1
tensorflow_datasets: 4.2.0
tensroflow_hub: 0.11.0
scipy: 1.6.0
matplotlib: 3.3.4
pandas: 1.2.1

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available to present the work related to the deep learning image classification task. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The data used for this project is available at [TensorFlow Datasets Catalog](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102)

The dnn model developed was also made available through a command-line tool. The predict.py and the dnn_image_classifier folder contain the necessary files for this funcionality.
